# Kids Investment Site

A simple Next.js style project with a few pages to help parents plan investments for their children.

## Pages

- **Home** (`/`): Links to tools.
- **Savings Calculator** (`/calculator`): Estimate future savings based on monthly contributions.
- **529 Plan Advantages** (`/529`): See state-specific tax benefits for 529 plans.
- **401k Info** (`/401k`): Learn when a child can start a 401k.

These pages use basic React components and minimal sample data. You can run them in any Next.js project by placing the `pages` folder in your app.
